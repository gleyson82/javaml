==========
Little has changed, but there are some experimental builds for 0.1.9
Moved to github.com

Update June 2013
===============
Java-ML has moved from SVN to Git hosting to foster better collaboration
https://sourceforge.net/p/java-ml/java-ml-code/ci/master/tree/

I have decided to move the GPL burdened code to a separate package and release the core under 
a less restrictive license in the future.   


Java-ML 0.1.7
=============
Last version of the first cycle
This version is licensed as GPL v2.0
